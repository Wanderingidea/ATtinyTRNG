# ATtinyTRNG
ATtinyTRNG - True Random Number Generator
Cor van Wandelen 4-2023

Rationale:<br>
A small generic True Random Number generator has been made by combining two random sources on a ATtiny85 board.

Method:<br>
The xored stream of random bytes made from the 8 available ADCs on a ATtiny85 MCU are combined with the xored stream of
random bytes made from CPU jitter.
Both random sources are checked for failure: if one of them fails the MCU is put to sleep.
A speed of appr. 96 B/s is achieved.

Tests:<br>
The following tests have been done at room temperature (19..22 degrees Celcius) on a file of 19MB that has been created by 
`cat /dev/ttyACM0 > test.bin:`<br>
Me:<br>
 minimum entropy: 1.00 bits per bit<br>

Ent:<br>
 Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.<br>
<br>
 Optimum compression would reduce the size<br>
 of this 204722968 bit file by 0 percent.<br>
<br>
 Chi square distribution for 204722968 samples is 0.28, and randomly<br>
 would exceed this value 59.77 percent of the times.<br>
<br>
 Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5000 (0.5 = random).<br>
 Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141752955 (error 0.01 percent).<br>
 Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000026 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).<br>

Compile and upload ATtinyTRNG.ino with Arduino CLI:<br>
`arduino-cli compile -e --fqbn digistump:avr:digispark-tiny ATtinyTRNG.ino`<br>
`arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn digistump:avr:digispark-tiny ATtinyTRNG.ino`<br>

Practical implementation in Linux:
in crontab @reboot:<br>
`stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel -opost -isig -icanon min 1 time 0`<br>
